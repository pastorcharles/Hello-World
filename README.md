# Hello-World
just another repository 
I'm a 1986 graduate of University of Cincinnati (Evening College) majoring in Information Processing Systems and Minoring in Business Administration. I'm currently a retired free-lance Programmer/Systems Analyst based out of Long Beach, CA. I'm learning new technologies to enhance my credentials and get some paid-employment.
The purpose of this readme is to learn and apply the github technology.
